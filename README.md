# Repository of machine learning algorithm used in Kaggle compitetion  
1.A logistic regression classifier using gradeint descend method, comparing with the logistic regression in sklearn, it may be a little bit slow(the sklearn used liblinear which is wrote in C programming language) but it can be used by beginner for learning the machine learning algorithm, users can debug it freely.
